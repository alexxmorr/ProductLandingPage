    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p id="mission-statement">Our mission as a company has always been to offer the best guitars at the best price, specifically for individuals who are just beginning on their journey to musician-ship! What better place to start than here at Guitars4All? We have a variety of body styles from Grand Concerts to the iconic Dreanought body shape. Regardless of your specific taste in Guitars, we are sure that you will find the one that's best for you here with us. Created by Alejandro Morales in his Mom's basement during 2020, he had the idea of curating a quality guitar company for communities who don't have access to high-end musical resources. We donate 80 percent of our profits to organizations who work to bring musical recreational activities to communities affected by economic and educational hardship. Here at Guitars4All, we believe that deep down inside, everyone is a musician!</p>
